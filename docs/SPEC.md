# RPPC One-Stop Operations System — Product & Technical Specification

| | |
|---|---|
| **Company** | Red Pallet Provider Co. (RPPC), S1 Group |
| **Version** | 0.6 — 2026-11-10 — second review fixed (Appendix E); **ready for Claude Code** (remaining assumptions in §18) |
| **Owner** | President & CEO |
| **Status** | Review draft. Decisions and assumptions are in §18. Build instructions for Claude Code are in §19. |

---

## 0. Decisions already made (carried into this spec)

1. Web app (mobile-first PWA) for office and field users. No native app in v1.
2. **Phase 1 = order-to-delivery.** Production capture, payroll, CRM, purchasing follow in later phases.
3. App is **standalone**. Invoice printing (BIR format, Crystal Reports) and accounting stay in **SAP B1**. Hand-off is by **manual export (CSV/XLSX)**, no live integration.
4. Payroll inside the app is **piece-rate computation only**. Statutory deductions and payslips remain with HR/Finance.
5. Pallet makers' daily counts are **approved by a supervisor/QC** before they count.
6. Sales creates sales orders for **verified, accredited clients only**. Operations creates delivery work orders and DRs. Finance bills from an **operations-generated, client-approved billing summary**.
7. No truck tracking in the app.
8. Mobile onsite repair (repair fee matrix, repair billing) is deferred to Phase 3.
9. System-generated DRs are accepted (a company memorandum will say so). A Crystal Report–printed DR can be attached when a client needs it.
10. **Billing starts when pallets are delivered and the DR is signed and received at the client site.**
11. Driver and helper pay is a **flat amount per trip**, regardless of distance.
12. Weekly piece-rate payroll cuts off on **Friday** (pallet makers, painters, onsite pallet makers). Admin payroll (15th/30th) stays outside the app.
13. The existing Pallet Pooling System is parked until after the first round of changes to this system.
14. Drivers get **₱1,000** and helpers **₱600** per trip, paid in the same weekly run as the pallet makers. Payday is Saturday afternoon: cash is handed out by HR, assisted by Security.
15. Rent **stops** when the RPPC team receives the pallets back on site.
16. Every petty-cash voucher is **approved by the Owner**; the Finance head/cashier releases the cash.
17. Delivery photos: 1–2 per stage, small files, each with **GPS and timestamp**.
18. The billing cutoff is set **per client and can be changed at any time** (Del Monte on the 25th is assumed).
19. Weekly pay period is **Saturday–Friday**. The Production Officer, HR and Security each verify the quantities **and** check the payout in the weekly sign-off, together with Finance.
20. As today, workers hand a **paper output sheet** to Security, who verify and **encode** it (now into the app instead of Google Sheets/Excel). The Production Officer approves.
21. Pallets come back in two ways: RPPC collects them (often after an audit at the client site) or the client delivers them to the RPPC plant. The damage class is recorded where the check happens.
22. The system **notifies approvers** (in-app, push, email) whenever something waits for their approval.
23. *(v0.5)* Deliveries made on a signed proposal conforme **before the contract is signed are billed at the proposal rate**, through `site_rate_terms` (BR-28).
24. *(v0.5)* **Client pickups skip the voucher** and the crew trip pay; they still have trip ticket, DR and gate pass (BR-26).
25. *(v0.5)* The weekly payroll is computed by a **system job**, not by a person; HR proposes adjustments and the Owner approves them.
26. *(v0.5)* If the Owner raises a voucher himself it is auto-approved and flagged; Finance still releases it (BR-27).
27. *(v0.6)* Return trips pay the crew and need a voucher; internal trips need neither (BR-29).
28. *(v0.6)* Lost pallets stop accruing rent when declared lost and are charged at replacement cost (BR-12; assumption 8 in §18).
29. *(v0.6)* An optional voucher delegate exists but is **off**; you decide whether to turn it on (§18).

### Changes in v0.2
Billing start moved from truck arrival to **signed DR received** (new `in_transit` step in the ledger); one DR per trip confirmed, with optional Crystal Report copy; trip pay is flat per trip; payroll now needs four sign-offs (Production Officer, Security on quantities only, HR, Finance) before Owner approval; pallet dynamic load fixed at 1,500 kg; BNEP, MRT and Growsari defined.

### Changes in v0.3
Rent now stops when the RPPC team receives pallets back on site (return receipt); trip pay fixed at ₱1,000/₱600 and merged into the weekly run; Saturday cash payout is recorded (HR distributes, Security witnesses); the Owner approves every voucher and Finance releases; photos need only 1–2 per stage but must carry GPS and a device timestamp (flagged when far from the site or the clock is off); client billing cutoff is changeable with history.

### Changes in v0.6
A second, independent review of v0.5 was checked line by line (Appendix E). Accepted and fixed: a `settings` table with seed; database grants and ownership rules; the missing `processed_ops` table; `proposal_sites` so multi-site clients are priced before the contract; damage, repair and lost charges frozen at return receipt and billed once; client-portal action permissions; trip pay limited to delivery and return trips and dated by unloading; no approval request for the Owner's own voucher; a disputed billing summary no longer blocks its revision; `updated_at` and its trigger attached everywhere; lockout for PINs; MFA recovery codes; notification preferences; and many integrity checks (trip-line freezing, over-delivery, billing totals, payroll sign-off round, worker pay type). Changed from the reviewer's patch because it would have broken the build: the trip-line freeze, the sign-off check and the invented `min_rate`. Found while checking: lost pallets kept accruing rent, and a damaged pallet could not be returned from a site that received it as class A; both fixed.

### Changes in v0.5
Fixed every finding from the Claude Code review (mapping in Appendix D) and the same class of problem elsewhere. **Billing:** pre-contract deliveries priced via new `site_rate_terms` (no overlaps possible); billing summaries can never overlap for a site; unpriced days block finalising. **Trips:** quantities moved to `trip_lines` (pallet type × condition); client pickups have their own no-voucher path; in-transit stock is tracked per trip. **Reissue:** voided documents and rejected entries can be re-created (partial unique indexes); wrong payroll lines are voided, not deleted. **Audit chain:** timestamps hashed as fixed UTC text via one shared function. **Security:** one permission catalog generates the code, the SQL seed and the §8.4 matrix; PIN sessions are technically barred from sensitive permissions; the app database role has its own RLS policy (§7.10). **Payroll:** computed by a system job, sign-offs tied to the frozen total and a round number, adjustments need Owner approval. **Smaller:** photo limit 2 MB everywhere, Philippine holiday calendar and `add_business_days`, trip pay dated by completion, composite client/site keys, sections reordered.

### Changes in v0.4
Security now verifies quantity **and** payout in the weekly sign-off; Security encodes workers' paper output sheets; returns have two modes (RPPC pickup, client delivers to plant) with damage class recorded where the check happens; added an approvals inbox with notifications and reminders; BAKLAS, PLAINER and CV defined; added a build guide for Claude Code (§19).

## 1. Business context

RPPC rents ECR wooden pallets (1200×1000 mm, block type, 4-way entry) to warehouses, distributors, manufacturers, FMCG companies and 3PLs. About 640,000 pallets have been deployed to date. Production is at the Mamplasan, Biñan, Laguna plant (roughly 10,000 pallets/month); lumber is milled in Mindanao and shipped by container.

**Today's problems** (from your brief and the attached files)

| Problem | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Everything runs on Excel, local storage and Google Drive backups | Brief |
| No sales order: sales ships from the proposal/contract and a delivery schedule | Brief |
| DR, gate pass and trip ticket made by hand | Brief |
| Proposals rebuilt per client in Word → PDF | Sample proposal (Onestop Warehousing, Oct 2024) |
| Production counts written on paper, keyed by guards, re-checked by HR in Excel | Production Tracker (one sheet per day, ~30 workers/day, 20+ activity lines) |
| Weekly payroll assembled manually (26–31 workers, ₱80k–₱162k/week in 2026) | Payroll Summary |
| Client concerns only in Messenger/Viber/WhatsApp, hard to trace | Brief |
| SAP B1 used for finance only; no inventory or purchasing module in use | Brief |

**Goals**

- G1 One record per order from proposal to billing, with no re-keying.
- G2 Prove every delivery (time in/out, photos, receiver signature).
- G3 Always know pallets per client site, per condition, and at the plant.
- G4 Bill on time: every invoice out before the 10th (25th for some clients).
- G5 Pay piece-rate workers from approved counts, automatically.
- G6 Secure by default: roles, approvals, segregation of duties, full audit trail.

**Scale:** under 100 users, ~3 trucks, a few thousand trips lifetime. A modular monolith on one PostgreSQL database is enough. Do not over-engineer.

## 2. Scope and phasing

| Phase | Modules | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| **0 Foundation** | Auth, MFA, roles/permissions, audit log, approvals inbox and notifications, masters (clients, sites, trucks, zones, employees), file storage, doc numbering, opening-balance import | Users log in by role; every action audited |
| **1 Order-to-delivery** | Proposals & contracts, sales orders, work orders, trips/trip tickets, vouchers, DR, gate pass, proof of delivery (photos, signature, time in/out), pallet inventory ledger, billing summary + SAP export, dashboards | One real client runs end-to-end in the app; billing summary matches Excel |
| **2 Production & payroll, audit, CRM** | Daily production capture (phone), supervisor approval, piece-rate payroll, driver/helper trip pay, pallet audit, client concerns tracker, employee gate pass | One weekly payroll run reconciles to the manual one |
| **3 Procurement & field** | Purchase requisition/PO/receiving, materials inventory, container shipments from Mindanao, mobile onsite repair, client portal, messaging-channel integrations | — |

Out of scope: BIR invoice issuance, general ledger/AR/AP, statutory payroll deductions, truck GPS tracking, live SAP integration.

## 3. Users and roles

Roles map to your current org lineup. Titles, not names, are used so the spec survives staff changes. **Confirm the mapping.**

| Role code | Who | Main work |
|---|---|---|
| `OWNER` | President & CEO | Final approvals (payroll, rates), **approves every petty-cash voucher**, full read, break-glass |
| `ADMIN_IT` | IT & QA officer | Users, roles, settings. **Cannot approve business documents** |
| `OPS_MGR` | Pallet Operations Manager | Approves dehire, inventory adjustments, billing review |
| `SALES_MGR` | Overall Sales Manager | Approves proposals, SOs, accreditation |
| `SALES` | ECR rental, storage, export sales | Proposals, contracts, sales orders, client requests |
| `DEPLOY` | ECR pallet deployment officer | Work orders, trips, trip tickets, DR, vouchers, zone matrix |
| `AUDITOR` | CSR pallet auditor | Pallet audits, damage classification |
| `CSR_REPAIR` | CSR repair charges/materials | Repair charges, materials stock |
| `PURCHASING` | Purchasing officer | PR/PO/receiving (Phase 3) |
| `HR` | HR & QA officer | Weekly payroll verifier (quantity and payout), employees, gate passes; **distributes the Saturday cash payout** |
| `BILLING` | Billing staff/intern | Billing summaries, send to client, SAP export |
| `FINANCE` | Finance head / cashier | Releases petty-cash budgets, payroll cash, billing export |
| `SUPERVISOR` | Production Officer (supervisor/QC) | Approves production counts; weekly payroll verifier (quantity and payout) |
| `GUARD` | Security guard (gate) | Verifies gate pass; **encodes workers' paper output sheets**; weekly payroll verifier (quantity and payout); witnesses the cash payout |
| `DRIVER` / `HELPER` | Fleet crew | Own trips, loading/unloading confirmation, POD photos |
| `WORKER` | Pallet makers, painters | Own earnings; own counts only if self-entry is switched on |
| `CLIENT` | Client contact (Phase 3) | Read-only own DRs, billing summaries; raise concerns |

## 4. Business rules (testable)

| ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| BR-01 | A sales order needs an **accredited** client, a signed proposal conforme **or** signed contract, and an **active rate term** (`site_rate_terms`) covering the requested date for that site, so every delivery can be priced. |
| BR-02 | Minimum deployment order is 240 pallets (one truckload). Lower needs `so.override_min_qty` with a reason. |
| BR-03 | One trip carries at most the truck capacity (default 240). |
| BR-04 | A delivery trip cannot be dispatched until it has: trip ticket, **released** petty-cash voucher number, issued DR, issued gate pass. Client pickups skip the voucher (BR-26). |
| BR-05 | Delivery is `free` or `charged` per proposal. Charged = fee per trip from the zone matrix, **even for partial loads**. |
| BR-06 | Rent **starts** when pallets are delivered and the DR is signed and received at the client site (`received_at`). Rent **stops** when the RPPC team receives the pallets back: at the client site when RPPC collects them (often after an audit there), or at the RPPC plant when the client delivers them. The damage class is recorded where the check happens. Pallets on a truck are `in_transit` and are not billed. Day count uses the end-of-day on-site balance, so the day rent starts counts and the day rent stops does not. |
| BR-07 | Billing summary is per client site per period. The cutoff day is **set per client and can be changed at any time** (default 10th; Del Monte on the 25th *(assumed)*). A change applies from the next period and never to an issued summary. The summary must be client-approved before Finance invoices. |
| BR-08 | After the invoice is received, the client has 5 business days to dispute in writing, else it is deemed accepted. Business days exclude Saturdays, Sundays and dates in the `holidays` table (`add_business_days`). The app tracks the deadline. |
| BR-09 | Payment terms: 30 days from invoice receipt (displayed only; collections are in SAP). |
| BR-10 | Proposals have a validity date; expired ones cannot be converted without re-approval. A contract must be signed within 15 days after the first delivery; the app raises an alert. Delivery is allowed on a signed proposal conforme, and is billed at the proposal rate until the contract term takes over (BR-28). |
| BR-11 | Physical pallet audit with the client at least monthly, with 5 days' notice to the client. |
| BR-12 | Damage classes (default rates, VAT-exclusive): A free; B ₱200; C ₱400; D ₱800; E ₱1,300; BER ₱1,300; Lost = replacement cost (`pallet_types.replacement_cost`). Overridable per contract. The charge per pallet is frozen when the return receipt is received. A pallet declared lost leaves the client site in the ledger at that moment (it stops accruing rent) and goes to the write-off location. |
| BR-13 | Issued documents (SO, DR, gate pass, billing summary) are never edited or deleted. They are **voided** with a reason. Numbers are never reused. |
| BR-14 | Pallet movements are append-only. Corrections are reversal entries approved by `OPS_MGR`. |
| BR-15 | Production entries count for pay only after supervisor approval; rejected entries can be re-entered. Rates are snapshotted at entry. Approved entries of a closed payroll period are locked. |
| BR-16 | Payroll chain: computed by the **system job** (no person computes it) → weekly sign-off by Production Officer, HR, Security (each checks quantities **and** the payout) and Finance → Owner approved → paid Saturday afternoon → locked. Pay period is Saturday–Friday. A period can be reopened by the Owner only before it is `paid`; reopening starts a new sign-off round. |
| BR-17 | Driver and helper pay is a flat **₱1,000 (driver)** and **₱600 (helper)** per completed trip, regardless of distance or load size, paid in the weekly run of the week in which the trip was **completed**. Amounts are Owner-set and effective-dated. |
| BR-18 | Only pallets are billed. Components, paint and nails are not. |
| BR-19 | Dehire before lock-in end needs `OPS_MGR` approval and is flagged for Sales. |
| BR-20 | A trip becomes `delivered` only with at least 1 loaded photo and 1 unloaded photo (max 2 per stage), each **captured in the app with GPS and a device timestamp**, plus receiver name + signature and time-in/time-out. Counts are configurable. |
| BR-21 | No user approves a record they created or are paid by (see §8.3). |
| BR-22 | A DR may carry an attached Crystal Report–printed copy (its number and a scan). The system DR number stays the primary reference. |
| BR-23 | Every petty-cash voucher is **approved by the Owner**; the Finance head/cashier releases the budget. No budget ceiling. |
| BR-24 | Payday is Saturday afternoon. HR distributes the cash, Security witnesses; each payout is recorded and acknowledged by the worker. Distributor ≠ witness. |
| BR-25 | Photos far from the client site (default >300 m) or with a device clock off by more than 10 minutes are **flagged for review**, not blocked. |
| BR-26 | A **client pickup** (the client's own truck loads at the plant) has no RPPC fuel/toll budget, so it needs no voucher and no driver/helper trip pay. It still needs trip ticket, DR and gate pass; the signed DR is received at the plant, and rent starts then. |
| BR-27 | If the **Owner** requests a voucher himself, it is auto-approved and flagged `owner_raised`; Finance's release is still required and must be by a different person. No approval request is created for the Owner's own approval. Optional delegate: see §18. |
| BR-28 | The rate applied to a day of rent is the one in the active `site_rate_terms` row for that site and date. A signed proposal creates a proposal term; the signed contract replaces it from the contract start date. Two active terms can never overlap, and a day with pallets on site but no term blocks finalising the billing summary. |
| BR-29 | Crew trip pay (BR-17) applies to `delivery` and `return` trips. `pickup` (BR-26) and `internal` trips pay no crew. `delivery` and `return` trips need a voucher; `pickup` and `internal` trips do not. |

## 5. Functional requirements

### M1 Clients and sites
- Client master: legal name, TIN, billing contact, accreditation status (`prospect` → `accredited` → `suspended`), billing cutoff day (changeable any time, applies from the next period), payment terms.
- A **principal** is the billed client; delivery sites belong to the client. Billing summary is per site.
- Only `SALES_MGR` can accredit. Accreditation needs a document upload (e.g. credit/KYC form).

### M2 Proposals and contracts
- Templates with merge fields (client, address, attention, qty, rate per pallet/day, period, delivery free/charged, repair matrix, validity, signatory).
- Generate PDF in one click; store every version. Replaces the per-client Word files.
- Send by email from the app (logged). Record conforme: upload signed copy or capture e-signature.
- Standard contract generated from the accepted proposal. Renewal alerts at 90/60/30 days before end.
- Rates below the floor (`settings.min_rate`) need `SALES_MGR` approval.
- **Rate terms**: when a proposal conforme is signed the system creates a `proposal` rate term for the site, so deliveries made before the contract is signed are still priced (BR-28). When the contract is signed it takes over from its start date; the database refuses overlapping terms.

### M3 Sales orders
- Types: `deployment`, `dehire`, `pallet_audit`, `onsite_deployment`.
- Sales fills client, site, qty, requested date, contact. System checks BR-01/02.
- Statuses: `draft → submitted → approved → scheduled → in_progress → fulfilled | cancelled`.
- Principal lead-time capture and production/delivery schedule (Gantt-style list) is a v1.1 view.

### M4 Work orders, trips, trip tickets, vouchers
- Operations turns an approved SO into delivery work orders, split into trips of ≤240. A trip carries one or more **lines** (pallet type × condition × qty); quantities are never a single number on the trip.
- Each trip = **trip ticket** (system number) + **voucher no.** (pre-numbered petty cash pad, keyed in) + **DR**.
- Staff request a voucher; the **Owner approves every voucher**; the Finance head/cashier releases the cash; the deployment officer logs and monitors. A voucher the Owner raises himself is auto-approved and flagged (BR-27). **Client pickups need no voucher** (BR-26). A voided or rejected voucher can be re-issued for the same trip.
- Zone matrix with a cost generator (km × diesel use × price) to propose the budget and the client fee.
- Rescheduling logs a reason (production delay, truck unavailable, client request).

### M5 Delivery receipt, gate pass, proof of delivery
- DR and gate pass are generated from the trip, PDF with QR code (verify URL). One DR per trip. If a client requires it, attach the Crystal Report–printed DR (number + scan); the memorandum that system DRs are valid is stored with the settings.
- Guard scans the QR at the gate: confirms qty and plate, records time out.
- Driver/helper app flow: **Arrive → GPS-stamped photos of loaded pallets (1–2) → depart → arrive site → time-in → unload → GPS-stamped photos unloaded (1–2) → receiver name + signature → time-out**. Works offline and syncs later. The signed-receipt time is the **billing start** (BR-06). If the signed paper DR comes back later, Operations enters the received date/time and scans it, and the pallets then move to the client site in the ledger.
- **Client pickup:** the client's own truck loads at the plant. Same trip ticket, DR and gate pass, but no voucher, no in-transit stage and no crew trip pay; the DR is signed at the plant and rent starts then (BR-26).
- **Return / dehire:** two modes. (a) **RPPC collects**: the team counts the pallets at the client site (often after a pallet audit there), records the damage class per pallet, takes GPS-stamped photos and records the return receipt; rent stops at that time. (b) **Client delivers to the plant**: the RPPC team counts and classifies at the plant; rent stops at plant receipt. Pallets leave the client site in the ledger at the receipt time.

### M6 Pallet inventory
- Ledger of movements between locations: plant, each client site, in transit, repair area, and external (production in, lost, scrapped).
- Balance by location × condition (A–E, BER) × pallet type. Delivery issues stock; return/dehire receives it; audit variances post adjustments.
- Opening balances imported per site (§14).

### M7 Billing summary
- Auto-built from the ledger: pallet-days per site × the rate term in force each day (one line per rate if the period spans a proposal→contract change), plus delivery fees, repair/lost charges. A day with pallets on site but no rate term blocks finalising the summary. Live summaries for a site can never overlap in dates.
- Workflow: `draft → ops_reviewed → sent_to_client → client_approved | disputed → exported`.
- Export CSV/XLSX for Finance to key into SAP/Crystal. After invoicing, Billing records invoice no. and receipt date; app computes the 5-business-day dispute deadline using the holiday calendar (maintained in Admin).
- Dashboard: invoices not yet out as of the 8th/9th; KPI "all invoices before the 10th".

### M8 Production and piece-rate payroll (Phase 2)
- Default process (as today): the worker writes output on a **paper sheet** and gives it to **Security**, who verify it and **encode** it in the app. The sheet is photographed and attached. Workers with phones may enter their own counts later (setting `production.allow_self_entry`, default off). Activities: fabrication (BNEP), repair by class, painting, dipping, branding, chamfering, **plainer** (planing lumber, notches for bottom boards), **baklas** (dismantling whole pallets), loading, unloading (including container vans), plus onsite lines by the Mobile Repair Team.
- The Production Officer approves daily; the person who encoded an entry cannot approve it. Flags: count above the worker's norm, duplicates, plant-yard mismatch (produced vs received into plant stock).
- Weekly payroll is computed by a **system job** every Saturday morning for the Sat–Fri period (nobody computes their own pay); per-worker lines, and the owner's **Weekly Payroll Summary** (total, headcount, average, highest, lowest) is a built-in report, labelled **gross** (piece-rate plus trip pay, before any deductions; it is not take-home pay).
- Driver and helper pay: flat ₱1,000 (driver) / ₱600 (helper) per completed trip, no distance factor, paid in the week the trip was completed. Drivers and helpers do not enter production counts.
- HR can read production and propose payroll **adjustments**; the Owner approves each one. The Owner can reopen a period only before it is paid; reopening voids the old sign-offs and starts a new round.
- Workers can see only their own earnings.
- Pay group: **weekly, Friday cutoff** for pallet makers, painters, onsite pallet makers, drivers and helpers. **Payday is Saturday afternoon**: HR hands out the cash with Security assisting, and each payout is acknowledged in the app. Admin staff (15th/30th) are not computed here.

### M9 Pallet audit (Phase 2)
- An audit may be done at the client site **before** a return; its damage classes feed the return receipt and the repair charges.
- Schedule with 5-day notice, count by condition class with a client representative, variance to system, charges per damage matrix, photo evidence.

### M10 Client concerns (CRM) (Phase 2)
- Ticket per concern: channel (Messenger, Viber, WhatsApp, email, call, visit), category, priority/SLA, assignee, linked DR/site/billing summary, thread and attachments.
- Phase 2: manual/forwarded entry and email-in. Phase 3: channel integrations (subject to provider approvals).

### M11 Procurement and materials (Phase 3)
- PR → approval by amount → PO → goods receipt → stock ledger. Lumber logs/components, nails, paint, chemicals, fuel.
- Container shipments from the Mindanao mill with received-vs-shipped reconciliation.

### M12 Admin
- Users, roles, permissions, settings, rate tables (effective-dated), **holiday calendar** (updated each year, used for business-day deadlines), audit log viewer, data exports.

### M13 Approvals inbox and notifications (Phase 0 skeleton, used by every module)
- Every record that waits for someone creates an **approval request** and notifies everyone who holds the approving permission: voucher → Owner; proposal/SO → Sales Manager; dehire/adjustment/billing review → Operations Manager; payroll sign-offs; production counts → Production Officer.
- Channels: in-app inbox with a count, **web push**, and **email** as fallback. Android Chrome supports push in the browser; on iPhone push works only when the app is installed to the Home Screen, so email stays on as backup.
- Open the notification → the record with **Approve / Reject** (reason required to reject). The requester can never approve their own request.
- Reminders: still pending after 2 hours in working hours → reminder (max 3). After 4 hours the Operations Manager gets an FYI (cannot approve). Daily digest of pending items at 07:30.
- Other alerts: contract and proposal expiry (90/60/30 days), billing cutoff in 3 days, dispute deadline, DR without proof of delivery, flagged photos, concern SLA due, backup failure. Users choose channels per kind, except security alerts.

## 6. Workflows (state machines)

```
SO:        draft → submitted → approved → scheduled → in_progress → fulfilled
                      ↓            ↓                        (any pre-fulfilled) → cancelled
                   rejected     (void only by SALES_MGR)

Trip:      delivery/return: planned → budget_approved → budget_released → loading → dispatched
                  → at_site → delivered → returned → closed        (cancel allowed before dispatched)
           client pickup (no voucher, BR-26): planned → loading → dispatched → delivered → closed

Billing:   draft → ops_reviewed → sent_to_client → client_approved → exported → invoiced
                                        ↘ disputed → (revised draft)

Payroll:   open → computed (by system job) → verifying (Production Officer, Security, HR, Finance each sign off) → owner_approved → paid (Saturday cash payout) → locked
           (each verifier checks the quantities and the payout; reopen allowed only before paid, new round)
```

Ledger timing: **dispatch** moves pallets plant → in_transit (not billable); **signed DR received** moves in_transit → client site (billing starts). Any shortfall is returned in_transit → plant in the same transaction. Every in-transit movement carries the trip id, so each truck is tracked separately. A client pickup goes plant → client site directly when the DR is signed. **Returns:** if RPPC collects, pallets move client site → in_transit when the RPPC team receives them (rent stops) and in_transit → plant on arrival; if the client delivers, they move client site → plant at the plant receipt (rent stops).


Every transition names the permission it needs (see §10.4) and writes an audit row.

## 7. Data model (PostgreSQL 16)

Conventions: `uuid` primary keys, `timestamptz` in UTC (display in Asia/Manila), money `numeric(14,2)` in PHP, no hard deletes for business documents (status `void`), every table has `created_at`/`updated_at`.

Rental line computation (one query per site and period). The rate comes from `site_rate_terms`, so a delivery made after
the proposal conforme but before the contract is signed is billed at the proposal rate (BR-01, BR-10), and a period that
spans a proposal→contract change produces one line per rate (stored as `rental` lines with `qty` = pallet-days). Any day with pallets on site but **no active rate term** is
returned as `unpriced_days`; the app refuses to finalise the summary while that is above zero (never bills ₱0 silently).

```sql
WITH days AS (                                   -- end-of-day pallets on site, all pallet types, per day

FROM priced

```

**Repair and lost charges.** They come from the frozen `charge_amount` of each received return-receipt line (§7.4), so the
amount never changes after the fact. Condition A is free; B–E and BER are charged at the damage matrix in force at
`received_at`; `lost` is charged at `pallet_types.replacement_cost`. Each source line is billed once.

```sql
INSERT INTO billing_summary_lines (summary_id, line_type, ref_type, ref_id, description, qty, unit_rate, amount)

### 7.10 Database roles and row-level security (Phase 3 portal; roles created in Phase 0)

The app connects as `app_user`. Client-portal requests run in a transaction that does `SET LOCAL ROLE app_client` and
`SELECT set_config('app.client_id', :client_id, true)`; Postgres then enforces the client boundary even if an API route
forgets a filter. `app_user` has its own explicit full-access policies, so enabling RLS never locks out the normal app.

```sql
DO $$ BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname = 'app_user')   THEN CREATE ROLE app_user LOGIN; END IF;
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname = 'app_client') THEN CREATE ROLE app_client NOLOGIN; END IF;
END $$;
GRANT app_client TO app_user;                    -- lets app_user SET LOCAL ROLE app_client

ALTER TABLE delivery_receipts  ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE billing_summaries  ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE sales_orders       ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- (the table owner / migration role bypasses RLS; app_user and app_client do not)

CREATE POLICY app_full_access ON delivery_receipts FOR ALL TO app_user USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY app_full_access ON billing_summaries FOR ALL TO app_user USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY app_full_access ON sales_orders      FOR ALL TO app_user USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- Clients see only their own rows, and only documents that were actually sent to them.
CREATE POLICY client_own_drs ON delivery_receipts FOR SELECT TO app_client
  USING (client_id = NULLIF(current_setting('app.client_id', true), '')::uuid AND status <> 'void');
CREATE POLICY client_own_bs ON billing_summaries FOR SELECT TO app_client
  USING (client_id = NULLIF(current_setting('app.client_id', true), '')::uuid
         AND status IN ('sent_to_client','client_approved','disputed','exported','invoiced'));
CREATE POLICY client_own_so ON sales_orders FOR SELECT TO app_client
  USING (client_id = NULLIF(current_setting('app.client_id', true), '')::uuid
         AND status NOT IN ('draft','void'));
GRANT SELECT ON delivery_receipts, billing_summaries, sales_orders TO app_client;
```

**Ownership.** Migrations run as a separate owner role (for example `rppc_migrator`), never as `app_user`: a table owner
bypasses row-level security, so if the app owned the tables the policies would silently do nothing. Check after every
migration: `SELECT tablename, tableowner FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname='public' AND tableowner IN ('app_user','app_client');`
must return no rows.

**Grants (least privilege).** Run as the owner role after all objects exist (and as the last statement of each migration
that adds tables). `app_user` gets no DDL, no `TRUNCATE`, and `DELETE` only where the business allows it.

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO app_user, app_client;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_user;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO app_user;      -- bigserial ids
GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO app_user;            -- next_doc_no, fn_* and so on
-- DELETE only on draft-stage child rows and housekeeping tables:
GRANT DELETE ON trip_lines, return_receipt_lines, billing_summary_lines, proposal_sites, contract_sites,
                pallet_audit_lines, ticket_message_files, push_subscriptions, notification_preferences,
                mfa_recovery_codes, sessions, processed_ops TO app_user;
-- Defence in depth on append-only tables (the triggers already refuse these):
REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE ON audit_log, pallet_movements FROM app_user;
-- Tables created by later migrations get the same grants automatically:
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON TABLES TO app_user;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO app_user;
```

If `app.client_id` is not set the policy matches nothing (fail closed). The portal never gets write access by SQL. Client
actions (approve or dispute a billing summary, raise a concern) are API routes running as `app_user`; each one checks
the matching `portal.*` permission, that the summary's `client_id` equals the session's client, and that its status is
`sent_to_client`, then writes the change and an audit row.

### 7.11 Shared triggers attached to every table (last migration step)

`set_updated_at()` was defined in §7.1 but must be attached. This step attaches it to **every table that has an
`updated_at` column** (append-only tables deliberately have none), so a table added later is covered by rerunning it.

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE r record;
BEGIN
  FOR r IN SELECT c.table_name FROM information_schema.columns c
           JOIN information_schema.tables t ON t.table_schema = c.table_schema AND t.table_name = c.table_name
          WHERE c.table_schema = 'public' AND c.column_name = 'updated_at' AND t.table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
  LOOP
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgrelid = format('public.%I', r.table_name)::regclass
                    AND tgname = 'set_updated_at') THEN
      EXECUTE format('CREATE TRIGGER set_updated_at BEFORE UPDATE ON public.%I FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION set_updated_at()', r.table_name);
    END IF;
  END LOOP;
END $$;
```

## 8. Security, roles and permissions

Target: OWASP ASVS Level 2 for the web app. Principle: **deny by default, enforce on the server, log everything that matters.**

### 8.1 Authentication

| Control | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Office users | Username/email + password, **argon2id** (≥19 MiB memory, 2 iterations, 1 lane, per OWASP guidance). Minimum 12 characters; check against a breached-password list; no composition rules. |
| MFA | TOTP **mandatory** for `OWNER`, `ADMIN_IT`, `FINANCE`, `HR`, `BILLING`, `OPS_MGR`, `SALES_MGR`. Recovery codes (hashed). Reset only by `ADMIN_IT` + `OWNER` confirmation. |
| Field users (driver, helper, guard, worker) | Often no email, so **device-bound PIN login**: phone is enrolled once by `ADMIN_IT`/`HR`; 6-digit PIN + enrolled device ID. These roles have narrow permissions (own trips / own counts only), and a PIN session is **technically barred** from every permission marked sensitive (†) in §8.4: money, approvals, exports, rates, user management (enforced in `requirePermission`, §10.3). The guard's two payroll duties (‡: Security sign-off, witnessing the payout) are allowed on a PIN session only within 5 minutes of re-entering the PIN. Office roles can never use PIN login. |
| Brute force | Per-account and per-IP rate limit; 5 failures → exponential lockout (1, 5, 15 min…); generic error messages; failures audited. |
| Sessions | Opaque 256-bit random token in a `__Host-` cookie: `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Path=/`. Only the SHA-256 hash is stored. Idle timeout 30 min (office), 12 h (enrolled field device). Absolute max 12 h office / 30 days field. Rotate on login and privilege change. Revoke all on password/PIN change. |
| Step-up | Re-enter password/TOTP (valid 10 min) for: payroll approval, payroll reopen, rate changes, role changes, break-glass, exports. Enforced for the permissions in `STEP_UP_PERMISSIONS`. |
| Offboarding | Disabling an employee disables the user and revokes sessions/devices in one action. |

### 8.2 Authorization model

- **RBAC**: users have roles; roles have permissions (`module.action`). Permissions are checked **server-side on every request**. The UI hides buttons, but hiding is cosmetic.
- **Scope (ABAC)**: a permission may be limited by scope: `CLIENT` users only see rows with their `client_id`; `DRIVER`/`HELPER` only their assigned trips; `WORKER` only their own entries/earnings. Scope checks live in the data-access layer, not in the controllers.
- **Defense in depth**: PostgreSQL row-level security for the client portal role (see §7.10). The app connects with a least-privilege DB role (no DDL, no `TRUNCATE`).
- **Admin ≠ approver**: `ADMIN_IT` manages users and settings but holds no business approval permissions.
- **Break-glass**: `OWNER` can reopen a locked payroll period or void a billed document **with a written reason**, step-up auth, and an automatic alert to Finance. Always audited.

### 8.3 Segregation of duties (enforced in code and, where possible, by DB `CHECK`)

| Control | Rule |
|---|---|
| Proposal / sales order | Creator ≠ approver (DB `CHECK` on sales orders) |
| Trip voucher | Requester ≠ approver (`OWNER`) ≠ releaser (`FINANCE`). If the Owner is the requester the voucher is auto-approved, flagged `owner_raised`, and Finance still releases (DB `CHECK`) |
| Production count | Enterer ≠ approver; nobody approves their own pay line |
| Payroll | Computed by the system job (no person); weekly sign-off by Production Officer, HR, Security (each checks quantities and the payout) and Finance; then `OWNER` approval; cash payout by HR witnessed by Security. One person per step (unique per round); a user cannot sign a period in which they are a payee. Sign-offs are given on the frozen total and are void if the period is reopened. HR adjustments need Owner approval. The person who encoded an entry cannot approve it |
| Rates (activity, zone, contract floor) | Only `OWNER`; effective-dated; never retroactive on approved entries |
| Inventory adjustment / reversal | Needs `OPS_MGR`; if the requester is `OPS_MGR`, `OWNER` approves |
| Purchase order (Phase 3) | Creator ≠ approver; thresholds in `approval_rules` |

### 8.4 Permission matrix (generated from §10.2 — do not edit by hand)

✔ = the role holds the permission. † = sensitive (not allowed on a PIN session). ‡ = PIN session allowed only with PIN re-entry.
Scope still applies on top: `CLIENT` sees only its own client's rows; `DRIVER`/`HELPER` only their assigned trips (`trips.own`);
`WORKER` only their own entries and earnings. `payroll.compute` has no human holder: the weekly computation is a system job.

Reading the matrix with the business rules: the Owner approves every voucher (`trips.approve_budget`) and Finance releases
the cash (`trips.release_budget`); an Owner-raised voucher is auto-approved but still needs Finance to release (BR-23). HR can
read production but cannot enter or approve it. Drivers and helpers have no production entry. HR can propose payroll
adjustments but only the Owner approves them. Billing and Finance can both export billing data; Billing prepares, Operations reviews.

### 8.5 Data protection

- **Transport**: HTTPS only, HSTS, TLS 1.2+. Internal DB traffic over TLS.
- **At rest**: encrypted disks/volumes and encrypted object storage; TOTP secrets and any bank/ID fields encrypted at the application layer (AES-256-GCM, key in a secrets manager, rotated). **Do not store government ID or bank account numbers in v1.**
- **Files**: private bucket; access only via **short-lived signed URLs** (≤5 min) issued after a permission check. Allow-list MIME types (JPEG, PNG, PDF), verify magic bytes, size limits (delivery photos ≤2 MB after on-device compression, other images ≤5 MB, PDF ≤15 MB), random storage keys, antivirus scan (ClamAV) before `scan_status='clean'`. Keep original EXIF in the DB row; serve re-encoded derivatives.
- **Web hardening**: strict CSP (no inline scripts), `X-Content-Type-Options`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, CSRF protection (SameSite + per-session token on mutating requests), output encoding, parameterised queries only, `zod` validation of every request body, upload and query param.
- **API**: rate limits per user/IP, idempotency keys on mutating field-app calls, pagination caps, no stack traces to clients, request IDs in logs.
- **Secrets**: never in the repo; environment/secret manager; separate dev/staging/prod; rotate on staff change.
- **Backups**: nightly encrypted full backup + WAL archiving (target RPO ≤ 1 h, RTO ≤ 4 h); copy kept off the primary provider; **restore tested monthly** and logged.
- **Logging/monitoring**: structured logs (no passwords, PINs, tokens, full photos); alerts for repeated login failures, role changes, exports, break-glass, backup failure. Logs retained ≥ 1 year.
- **Audit trail**: hash-chained `audit_log` (§7.1) written in the same transaction as the change. A nightly job runs `fn_verify_audit_chain()` and alerts on any break.
- **Dependencies**: lockfile, automated dependency audit in CI, pinned base images.

### 8.6 Philippine data privacy

The system holds personal data of employees (names, pay, attendance) and client contacts. The Data Privacy Act of 2012 (RA 10173) applies. Practical consequences: appoint a Data Protection Officer, give employees a privacy notice, keep access need-to-know (the matrix above), set retention periods (e.g. production/payroll lines 5 years — confirm with your accountant/counsel), and have a breach-response procedure. Review the NPC registration/notification requirements with counsel. Electronic signatures on proposals/contracts/DR: confirm acceptable evidence standards with counsel before relying on in-app signatures alone; keep the "upload signed copy" path. Delivery photos carry the crew member's GPS position and time at the moment of capture only; there is no continuous tracking. State this in the employee privacy notice.

### 8.7 Threats this design addresses (abuse cases)

| Abuse case | Control |
|---|---|
| Inflated production counts for pay | Supervisor approval, SoD, above-norm flag, plant-yard reconciliation, rate snapshot, audit trail |
| Fake or reused DR / delivery not made | Gap-free numbers, void-only, QR verification at gate, POD photos with device time, receiver signature |
| Pallets "disappearing" | Append-only ledger, negative-stock block, reversal needs manager, monthly audit variance |
| Budget/voucher leakage | Three-way SoD (request/approve/release), voucher no. unique, liquidation vs actual |
| Rate tampering to under/over-bill | Owner-only effective-dated rates, contract rate snapshot, billing summary immutable once client-approved |
| Insider data export | Export permission separate from read; exports audited and rate-limited; step-up auth |
| Stolen phone of a driver | Device revocation, PIN lockout, narrow scope, short idle timeout |
| Lost admin account | Mandatory MFA, step-up for critical actions, break-glass alerting |

## 9. Architecture and API

**Stack (recommended)**

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| App | TypeScript, Next.js (App Router) as one deployable; route handlers = API | One codebase, easy for one developer or an AI-assisted build |
| DB | PostgreSQL 16 | Transactions, constraints, triggers and RLS do real work here |
| Jobs | `pg-boss` (Postgres-backed) | No Redis to run: alerts, renewals, nightly checks, report snapshots |
| Files | S3-compatible object storage, private bucket | Signed URLs, cheap |
| PDF | HTML templates → PDF via headless Chromium | Matches your letterhead; one template per document type |
| Field app | Same web app as an installable **PWA**; IndexedDB queue for offline | Works on cheap Android phones, no app-store step |
| Hosting | One VPS/PaaS in a Singapore region + managed or self-run Postgres | Closest region to the Philippines |

```
repo/
  apps/web/            Next.js app (UI + API routes)
  packages/db/         SQL migrations (numbered), seed, query helpers
  packages/core/       rbac, state machines, billing, payroll, numbering (pure, unit-tested)
  packages/pdf/        templates + renderer
  ops/                 docker-compose, backup scripts, runbooks
```

**Endpoint groups** (all under `/api/v1`, JSON, cookie session, every route declares its permission)

| Area | Endpoints |
|---|---|
| Auth | `POST /auth/login`, `/auth/mfa/verify`, `/auth/pin-login`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/devices` |
| Clients | `GET/POST /clients`, `POST /clients/:id/accredit`, `GET/POST /clients/:id/sites` |
| Proposals | `POST /proposals`, `POST /proposals/:id/submit`, `/approve`, `/render-pdf`, `/send`, `/conforme` |
| Contracts | `POST /contracts` (from proposal), `/sign`, `GET /contracts/expiring` |
| Sales orders | `POST /sales-orders`, `/submit`, `/approve`, `/cancel`, `/void` |
| Operations | `POST /work-orders`, `POST /trips`, `/trips/:id/budget/approve`, `/budget/release`, `/dispatch` |
| Documents | `POST /trips/:id/dr`, `/trips/:id/gate-pass`, `GET /verify/:token` (QR) |
| Field (offline) | `POST /sync` (batch of ops with `client_op_id`), `POST /uploads/sign`, `POST /uploads/:id/confirm` |
| Inventory | `GET /inventory/balances`, `POST /inventory/adjustments`, `POST /inventory/reversals` |
| Billing | `POST /billing-summaries/generate`, `/review`, `/send`, `/client-approval`, `/export`, `/invoice-info` |
| Production/payroll | `POST /production-entries`, `/submit`, `/approve`, `POST /payroll/periods/:id/compute`, `/verify`, `/finance-check`, `/approve`, `/export` |
| Tickets | `GET/POST /tickets`, `POST /tickets/:id/messages` |
| Returns | `POST /return-receipts`, `POST /return-receipts/:id/receive` |
| Approvals | `GET /approvals/inbox`, `POST /approvals/:id/approve`, `/reject`, `GET /notifications`, `POST /notifications/:id/read`, `POST /push/subscribe` |
| Admin | `GET/POST /users`, `/roles`, `/settings`, `GET /audit-log` |

### 9.1 Scheduled jobs (pg-boss)

Jobs run as the `system` actor (seeded in §10.1, disabled for login), connect with the same `app_user` database role, and
write audit rows like any user. `payroll.compute` belongs to no human role.

| Job | When (Asia/Manila) | What |
|---|---|---|
| weekly-payroll | Saturday 06:00 | Compute the Sat–Fri period (§10.7), freeze the total, notify the four verifiers |
| approval-reminders | every 30 min, 06:00–22:00 | Reminders and FYIs (§5 M13); 07:30 daily digest |
| contract-sign-alert | daily 08:00 | Contracts not signed 10 and 15 days after first delivery (BR-10); proposal/contract expiry at 90/60/30 days |
| billing-cutoff-alert | daily 08:00 | Cutoff in 3 days per client (`v_client_current_cutoff`); dispute deadlines (BR-08) |
| audit-chain-verify | nightly 02:00 | `fn_verify_audit_chain()`; alert on any break |
| holiday-calendar-check | 1 December | Alert Admin if next year's holidays are not loaded |
| unpriced-days-check | daily 07:00 | Sites with pallets on site and no active rate term (BR-28) |
| backup-restore-test | monthly | Restore test logged (§8.5) |

## 10. Reference code

These are **reference implementations** of the security-critical and business-critical pieces. They show intent and shape; run them under tests (§15) before relying on them.

### 10.1 Seed: roles and permissions

The audit-chain verifier lives with its table in §7.1 (`fn_verify_audit_chain`, built on the same `audit_row_hash` the trigger uses).
The permission rows below are **generated from the one catalog in §10.2**; do not edit them by hand.

### 10.2 Permissions and role mapping — the single catalog (`packages/core/rbac.ts`)

This catalog is the **only** place permissions are defined. The `P` constants, `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`, the §10.1 SQL seed and the
§8.4 matrix are all generated from it (`pnpm gen:rbac`); CI fails if any generated copy differs from the catalog. Each
permission has a sensitivity: `normal`; `sensitive` (money, approvals, exports, rates, user management — never allowed on a
PIN session, see §8.1); `pin_stepup` (the two guard duties on payroll — allowed on a PIN session only after PIN re-entry).

### 10.4 State machine with permission per transition (`packages/core/trip.ts`)

The path depends on the trip type. A **client pickup** (the client's own truck loads at the plant) has no RPPC fuel/toll
budget, so it has no voucher step (BR-26); the voucher steps exist only when `trips.voucher_required` is true.

```ts
import { P, Permission } from './rbac';

export type TripType = 'delivery' | 'pickup' | 'return' | 'internal';
export type TripStatus = 'planned' | 'budget_approved' | 'budget_released' | 'loading' | 'dispatched'
  | 'at_site' | 'delivered' | 'returned' | 'closed' | 'cancelled';
type Transitions = Record<TripStatus, Partial<Record<TripStatus, Permission>>>;

const WITH_VOUCHER: Transitions = {

  budget_released: { loading: P.TRIP_DISPATCH, cancelled: P.TRIP_WRITE },
  loading:         { dispatched: P.GATEPASS_VERIFY },          // guard verifies the gate pass at the gate
  dispatched:      { at_site: P.TRIP_OWN },
  at_site:         { delivered: P.TRIP_OWN },
  delivered:       { returned: P.TRIP_OWN },

  at_site: {}, returned: {},
  delivered:       { closed: P.TRIP_WRITE },
  closed: {}, cancelled: {},
};
// Plant-to-plant move: no voucher, no DR signature, the Deployment Officer closes the movement.
const NO_VOUCHER_INTERNAL: Transitions = { ...NO_VOUCHER_PICKUP, dispatched: { delivered: P.TRIP_DISPATCH } };
export const transitionsFor = (t: TripType): Transitions =>
  t === 'pickup' ? NO_VOUCHER_PICKUP : t === 'internal' ? NO_VOUCHER_INTERNAL : WITH_VOUCHER;
// Meaning of the statuses on a RETURN trip (RPPC truck collects from the client; it uses WITH_VOUCHER):

### 10.5 Posting a delivery to the ledger

Every movement into or out of `in_transit` carries the `trip_id`, and a trip can have several type/condition lines, so each
line is posted separately and one truck's pallets can never be unloaded by another.

```ts
const MOVE = `INSERT INTO pallet_movements
  (occurred_at, pallet_type_id, condition, qty, from_location_id, to_location_id, ref_type, ref_id, trip_id, created_by)
  VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$7,$8,$9,$10)`;

// Guard verifies the gate pass (trip → dispatched): pallets leave the plant but are NOT billable yet (BR-14).
export async function postDispatch(tx: Tx, trip: TripRow, actor: Actor) {
  const { rows } = await tx.query<LineRow>(`SELECT * FROM trip_lines WHERE trip_id=$1 AND qty_loaded > 0`, [trip.id]);
  for (const l of rows) {
    await tx.query(MOVE, [new Date(), l.palletTypeId, l.condition, l.qtyLoaded,
      PLANT_LOCATION_ID, IN_TRANSIT_LOCATION_ID, 'trip', trip.id, trip.id, actor.id]);
  }
}

// At the at_site → delivered transition (TRIP_OWN): unloading is finished and the proof of delivery is complete.
// The signed DR may still be on paper. completed_at is set HERE, so a late paper DR never delays the crew's pay (BR-17).
export async function markDelivered(tx: Tx, trip: TripRow, dr: DrRow, deliveredAt: Date, actor: Actor) {
  assertPodComplete(await loadPodEvidence(tx, trip.id), trip.tripType as TripType);
  await tx.query(`UPDATE delivery_receipts SET status='delivered', delivered_at=$2 WHERE id=$1 AND status='issued'`, [dr.id, deliveredAt]);

}

// Called in ONE transaction when the signed DR is received (DR_RECEIVE: the app, or Operations entering the paper DR) (BR-06, BR-14).
// Rent starts at dr.receivedAt. Any shortfall (loaded − delivered) goes back in_transit → plant. completed_at is not touched.
export async function postDelivery(tx: Tx, trip: TripRow, dr: DrRow, actor: Actor) {
  const { rows } = await tx.query<LineRow>(`SELECT * FROM trip_lines WHERE trip_id=$1 FOR UPDATE`, [trip.id]);
  for (const l of rows) {
    const delivered = l.qtyDelivered ?? 0, short = (l.qtyLoaded ?? 0) - delivered;
    if (delivered > 0) {   // the DB guard rejects it if THIS truck holds fewer pallets than delivered
      await tx.query(MOVE, [dr.receivedAt, l.palletTypeId, l.condition, delivered,
        IN_TRANSIT_LOCATION_ID, dr.siteLocationId, 'delivery_receipt', dr.id, trip.id, actor.id]);
    }
    if (short > 0) {

        IN_TRANSIT_LOCATION_ID, PLANT_LOCATION_ID, 'trip_shortfall', trip.id, trip.id, actor.id]);
    }
  }
  await tx.query(`UPDATE delivery_receipts SET status='received', received_at=$2 WHERE id=$1`, [dr.id, dr.receivedAt]);
  await audit(tx, actor, 'dr.received', 'delivery_receipt', dr.id, null, { lines: rows.length });
}

  await audit(tx, actor, 'dr.received_pickup', 'delivery_receipt', dr.id, null, { lines: rows.length });
}

The client-portal row-level security policies are in §7.10.

### 10.6 Offline field sync (idempotent) and secure uploads

```ts
// Driver phone queues operations while offline; each has a client-generated UUID.
const SyncOp = z.object({
  client_op_id: z.string().uuid(),
  type: z.enum(['trip_event', 'pod_photo_ref', 'receiver_signature']),
  trip_id: z.string().uuid(),
  payload: z.record(z.unknown()),
  device_at: z.string().datetime(),
});

export const POST = route(P.TRIP_OWN, async (req, actor) => {
  const ops = z.array(SyncOp).max(100).parse(await req.json());
  const results = [];
  for (const op of ops) {
    await assertTripAssignedTo(actor, op.trip_id);                 // scope: own trips only
    results.push(await db.tx(async (tx) => {
      const seen = await tx.query('SELECT result FROM processed_ops WHERE client_op_id=$1', [op.client_op_id]);
      if (seen.rowCount) return seen.rows[0].result;                // replay: same answer, no double effect
      const result = await applyOp(tx, actor, op);
      await tx.query('INSERT INTO processed_ops (client_op_id, user_id, result) VALUES ($1,$2,$3)',
        [op.client_op_id, actor.id, result]);
      return result;
    }));
  }
  return Response.json({ results });
});
// processed_ops(client_op_id uuid PRIMARY KEY, user_id uuid NOT NULL, result jsonb, created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now())

});

### 10.7 Piece-rate payroll computation

The weekly computation is a **system job** (pg-boss, Saturday 06:00 PHT for the Sat–Fri period that just ended); no person runs it,
so nobody computes or approves their own pay. A person can only (a) propose an adjustment (HR, then Owner approves) or (b) ask the
Owner to reopen a period that is not yet `paid`. Everything below runs in one transaction.

```sql
-- Entries are priced at entry time: the rate in force that day, client-specific rate first.
SELECT r.rate
FROM activity_rates r
WHERE r.activity_id = :activity
  AND (r.client_id = :client OR r.client_id IS NULL)
  AND r.effective_from <= :work_date AND (r.effective_to IS NULL OR r.effective_to >= :work_date)
ORDER BY (r.client_id IS NOT NULL) DESC, r.effective_from DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Compute a period: approved entries only, lock them in the same transaction.
INSERT INTO payroll_lines (period_id, employee_id, source, ref_id, description, qty, rate, amount)
SELECT :period, e.worker_id, 'production', e.id, a.name, e.qty, e.rate_snapshot, e.amount
FROM production_entries e JOIN production_activities a ON a.id = e.activity_id
WHERE e.status = 'approved' AND e.work_date BETWEEN :start AND :end;

UPDATE production_entries SET status = 'locked'
WHERE status = 'approved' AND work_date BETWEEN :start AND :end;
```

Trip pay: one flat line per crew member per completed trip, rate by role and date (BR-17). It is earned on the day the trip
was **completed** (`trips.completed_at`, Manila date), not the day it was planned: for a delivery that is when unloading
finished (`markDelivered`), for a return when the truck is back at the plant, so a late paper DR never delays pay. A trip
planned on Friday and finished on Saturday is paid in the following week's run and never twice. The unique index `payroll_line_once` blocks double payment.

```sql
WITH crew AS (
  SELECT t.id AS trip_id, t.trip_no, t.driver_id AS employee_id, 'driver'::text AS crew_role,
         (t.completed_at AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Manila')::date AS d
    FROM trips t
   WHERE t.completed_at IS NOT NULL AND t.status <> 'cancelled' AND t.driver_id IS NOT NULL
     AND t.trip_type IN ('delivery','return')              -- pickup and internal trips pay no crew (BR-26, BR-29)
     AND (t.completed_at AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Manila')::date BETWEEN :start AND :end
  UNION ALL
  SELECT t.id, t.trip_no, h.employee_id, 'helper', (t.completed_at AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Manila')::date
    FROM trips t JOIN trip_helpers h ON h.trip_id = t.id
   WHERE t.completed_at IS NOT NULL AND t.status <> 'cancelled'
     AND t.trip_type IN ('delivery','return')
     AND (t.completed_at AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Manila')::date BETWEEN :start AND :end
)
INSERT INTO payroll_lines (period_id, employee_id, source, ref_id, description, qty, rate, amount)
SELECT :period, c.employee_id, 'trip', c.trip_id, 'Trip ' || c.trip_no, 1, r.amount_per_trip, r.amount_per_trip
  FROM crew c
  JOIN trip_pay_rates r ON r.crew_role = c.crew_role AND r.effective_from <= c.d
                       AND (r.effective_to IS NULL OR r.effective_to >= c.d);

-- Close the computation: freeze the figure that the four sign-offs will be given on.
UPDATE payroll_periods
   SET status = 'computed', computed_at = now(), computed_by_job = 'weekly-payroll',
       total_snapshot = (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) FROM payroll_lines WHERE period_id = :period AND voided_at IS NULL)
 WHERE id = :period AND status = 'open';
```

Reopen (Owner only, reason required, step-up, audited; refused once the period is `paid`): void the system-generated lines
with `void_reason`, set the locked entries back to `approved`, set the period to `open` and add 1 to `round`. Earlier sign-offs
stay on record but only sign-offs of the current round count, and each must show a `total_seen` equal to the new `total_snapshot`.

### 10.8 Returns and approval requests

```ts
// Rent stops at rr.receivedAt (BR-06). Sequence for a return (who calls what):
//   1. Operations/Auditor (returns.record) fills the receipt and its lines; status stays 'draft'.
//   2. postReturn: set received_at, freeze the charges (fn_snapshot_return_charges), move the pallets, status = 'received'.
//   3. RPPC pickup only: when the truck is back at the plant, postReturnArrival unloads exactly what that trip carries.
// 'lost' lines are charged at replacement cost AND moved to the write-off location, so a lost pallet stops accruing rent.

## 11. Non-functional requirements

| Area | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Devices | Android Chrome (mid-range phones) and desktop Chrome/Edge. Touch targets ≥ 44 px; large-type driver screens |
| Connectivity | Driver/helper/guard flows work **offline**; sync on reconnect; photos compressed before upload (target ≤ 500 KB, hard cap 2 MB), with GPS and time stored per photo |
| Performance | Page loads ≤ 2 s on 4G; billing generation for 100 sites ≤ 60 s |
| Availability | 99.5% monthly in business hours (06:00–22:00 PHT); maintenance windows announced |
| Time and money | Store UTC, display `Asia/Manila`; PHP only; VAT 12% computed in exports, rates stored VAT-exclusive |
| Language | English UI; Filipino labels for field screens where helpful |
| Accessibility | Readable contrast, no information by color alone |
| Data | Retention schedule per §8.6; soft-void only for documents; exports always include a document hash/version |

## 12. Integrations and exports (v1: manual by design)

| Export | Format | Consumer | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| Billing summary pack | CSV + PDF | Finance → SAP B1 / Crystal Reports | client code, site, period, pallet-days, rate, rental, delivery fees, repair charges, DR list, client approval ref |
| Payroll register | CSV/XLSX | HR/Finance | week, employee no., line detail, totals (piece-rate gross only) |
| Trip budget/voucher register | CSV | Finance | trip no., voucher no., budget, released, actual |
| Pallet inventory snapshot | CSV | Anyone with `inventory.read` | balances by location/condition |

Each export is permission-gated, audited, stamped with who/when/filters, and filename-versioned. A live SAP B1 integration (Service Layer or DI API) is a possible Phase 4 and is out of scope now.

## 13. Reports and dashboards

- **Owner**: pallets deployed (total, by region, by client), pallets at plant vs in circulation, trips this week, billing progress vs cutoff, payroll weekly summary (gross), open client concerns by age.
- **Operations**: today's trips and status, DR without POD, pending vouchers, stock by condition, pending audits, reschedules by reason.
- **Billing/Finance**: summaries by status, awaiting client approval, dispute deadlines, KPI "invoices sent before the 10th", export log.
- **Production**: output per day per activity, per worker, pallets fabricated vs received at yard, flagged entries, payroll per week.
- **Sales**: proposals by status and validity, contracts expiring in 90 days, sales orders by client.

## 14. Data migration and opening balances

1. Import clients, sites, active contracts/proposals (CSV templates provided in the build).
2. **Opening pallet balance per site**: one `ref_type='opening_balance'` movement from the `external` location to each site, dated the cut-over day; reconciled against your latest pallet inventory report and the 640,000 deployed figure before go-live. Unknown condition mix is booked as `A` and corrected by audits.
3. Load the activity/rate table from the Production Tracker (Appendix B) after you confirm the rates.
4. Load employees and enroll devices.
5. **Parallel run**: Phase 1 runs beside Excel for one full billing cycle; the billing summary must match Excel to the peso before Excel is retired.
6. The **Pallet Pooling System** named in the company profile is parked until after the first round of changes. Version 1 starts from opening balances.
7. Pallet type `ECR-1200x1000`: dynamic load **1,500 kg** (confirmed); static load 3,000 kg is taken from the company profile and still to be confirmed.
8. Trip pay: driver ₱1,000, helper ₱600 per trip. Client cutoffs: Del Monte on the 25th *(assumed)*, all others on the 10th until you say otherwise.

## 15. Testing and acceptance

| Layer | What |
|---|---|
| Unit | Rental-day math (delivery day counts, return day does not, same-day in/out), zone fee on partial loads, rate selection, SoD helpers, state machines |
| DB | Negative-stock trigger, immutability triggers, doc-number gap-free under concurrency (100 parallel inserts), audit chain verification |
| Integration | End-to-end: proposal → SO → trip → DR → POD → ledger → billing summary → export |
| Security | Every route has a permission; test matrix proves each role is denied what it should be; IDOR tests (client A cannot read client B; driver cannot read others' trips); upload abuse; session fixation; CSRF; rate limiting; dependency audit in CI |
| Offline | Airplane-mode delivery, double-submit replay, clock-skewed phone |
| UAT scripts | One per role, run by the real staff member, signed off before each phase release |

**Phase 1 acceptance:** (1) a real client's month is billed from the app and matches Excel; (2) 20 consecutive trips complete with POD and no manual paper except the physical voucher; (3) a deliberate attempt to self-approve, dispatch without a voucher, or take negative stock is blocked and audited.

## 16. Delivery plan (indicative)

| Step | Content | Effort (1 dev + AI assist) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Foundation, auth, RBAC, audit, masters, files | 3–4 weeks |
| 1a | Proposals/contracts/PDF, sales orders | 3 weeks |
| 1b | Work orders, trips, vouchers, DR, gate pass, POD PWA | 4–5 weeks |
| 1c | Inventory ledger, billing summary, exports, dashboards, parallel run | 3–4 weeks |
| 2 | Production capture, approvals, piece-rate payroll, audit, concerns | 6–8 weeks |
| 3 | Procurement, onsite repair, client portal, channels | 8+ weeks |

Estimates are rough and depend on answers to §18 and on how much of the build is delegated. They are the optimistic case: the
step 0 and step 1 rows add up to about 14 weeks of pure build, but with review, fixes after each slice, training, the
parallel billing cycle and opening-balance reconciliation, plan **5–6 months** from start to a trusted Phase 1 go-live, and
**2–3 more months** for Phase 2. Plan the parallel run and staff training against that range, not the table.

## 17. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Field staff low phone literacy/connectivity | Big-button screens, offline queue, supervisor encoding fallback, short training + UAT per role |
| Parallel Excel and app drift | Single cut-over date per module; Excel read-only after parallel run |
| Wrong opening balances | Reconcile per site; audits correct; adjustments need approval |
| Rule ambiguity (day counting, deemed acceptance) | Make configurable; decide in §18 before building billing |
| Regulatory questions (system-generated DR, e-signature, privacy) | Confirm with your accountant/counsel before relying on them |
| Messaging-channel integrations (Messenger/WhatsApp/Viber) need provider business verification and may not expose personal chats | Phase 3, manual/forward capture first |
| Phone GPS and clocks can be faked or wrong | Photos are taken in the app only (no gallery), accuracy recorded, flags for far-from-site and clock skew, Operations reviews flagged trips, occasional call-back to the client |
| One-developer dependency | Documentation, tests, runbooks, migrations in repo. A second reviewer (a developer or a paid security reviewer) for the security-critical slices: authentication, RBAC, ledger, payroll |
| Owner is the only voucher approver, so dispatch stops when he is away | Approval reminders and push; optional named delegate (`vouchers.allow_owner_delegate`, off by default, flagged, audited, §18). Decide before Phase 1 go-live |
| Lost or damaged-pallet charges are revenue | Charges frozen at return receipt from the contract matrix; lost pallets leave the site ledger; both are billed once and audited |
| Legal confirmations left until after go-live | Confirm the system-DR memorandum, e-signature acceptability, data-privacy registration and retention periods **before** Phase 1 go-live |

## 18. Decisions log and assumptions

### Decided

| Topic | Decision | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Pooling system | Parked until after the first round of changes | §14 |
| DR | One per trip; system DRs accepted via memorandum; Crystal Report copy attachable | BR-22 |
| Rent start | Delivered and DR signed and received at the client site | BR-06 |
| Rent stop | RPPC team receives pallets back: at the client site (pickup) or at the plant (client delivers) | BR-06, §7.4 |
| Damage class | Recorded where the check happens: client site audit before return, or at the RPPC plant | §5 M5, M9 |
| Pallet spec | Dynamic load 1,500 kg | §14 |
| Trip pay | ₱1,000 driver, ₱600 helper, flat per trip, weekly run | BR-17 |
| Pay period | Saturday–Friday; payday Saturday afternoon; cash by HR, witnessed by Security | BR-16, BR-24 |
| Weekly sign-off | Production Officer, HR, Security (quantity and payout) and Finance; then Owner | §8.3 |
| Counts | Paper sheet to Security, who encode; Production Officer approves | §5 M8 |
| Vouchers | Owner approves all; Finance head/cashier releases; no ceiling | BR-23 |
| Photos | 1–2 per stage, small, GPS and timestamp mandatory; flagged, not blocked | BR-20, BR-25 |
| Billing cutoff | Per client, changeable any time with history | BR-07 |
| Approvals | Approvers are notified in-app, by push and by email, with reminders | §5 M13 |
| Terms | BNEP, MRT, Growsari, BAKLAS, PLAINER, CV | Appendix A |
| Proposal sites | One proposal may list several sites at the same rate; a site-specific rate is a separate proposal | §7.3 |
| Return and internal trips | Return trips need a voucher and pay the crew; internal trips need neither; pickups need neither (BR-29) | BR-29 |
| Trip pay date | Manila date of `completed_at`: unloading finished (delivery), handover at plant (pickup), truck back at plant (return) | §10.5, §10.7 |
| Damage and lost charges | Frozen at return receipt from the contract (or proposal) matrix; lost = replacement cost | BR-12, §7.4, §7.6 |
| Disputed billing | The revision is a new draft (`revised_from_id`); the disputed one is voided when the revision is exported | §7.6 |

### Assumptions you can change later (no answer needed now)

1. Del Monte's cutoff is the 25th; all other clients use the 10th until you change them. A billing summary runs from the day after the previous cutoff through this cutoff.
2. There is no alternate voucher approver by default: you get reminders instead. If you will be away, turn on `vouchers.allow_owner_delegate` and name one delegate (`vouchers.delegate_user_id`): their approvals are flagged, you are alerted, Finance still releases, and step-up is required. Only trip vouchers are in scope; other petty cash can follow later.
3. Photo flags: more than 300 m from the site, or a phone clock off by more than 10 minutes.
4. The client acknowledges the return count when RPPC collects; for a client delivery the plant count is the record.
5. Static load is 3,000 kg (from the company profile).
6. Stack and hosting as in §9 (one Singapore-region host).
7. Client portal comes in Phase 3. The role mapping in §3 is as written.
8. **Lost pallets stop accruing rent** when they are declared lost on a return receipt, and the replacement cost is charged. If your contracts say rent continues until the replacement is paid, tell me and this changes.
9. `min_rate`, the zone cost parameters, the replacement cost per pallet type and the system-DR memorandum file are intentionally empty in the seed: you (or Finance) set them before go-live. The app blocks the related feature until they are set.
10. Client-site stock is read by pallet type only; the condition of returning pallets is recorded where the check happens (§7.5).
11. `audit_log` keeps the column names `at`, `before`, `after` because the hash function depends on them; `trips.status = 'returned'` means the truck is back at the plant and is distinct from `trip_type = 'return'` (note this in `CLAUDE.md`).

## 19. Build guide for Claude Code

**Use:** save this file as `docs/SPEC.md` in a new repo, add the `CLAUDE.md` below, then build **one slice at a time**. The SQL in §7 (sections 7.1 to 7.11, run in order, plus the seed in §10.1) was loaded and tested on PostgreSQL 16. The TypeScript in §10 is reference code: it was type-checked (`tsc --strict`) but not run, so write tests first. `packages/core/rbac.ts` is generated: edit the catalog, never the derived lists.

### 19.1 `CLAUDE.md` (put in the repo root)

````md
# RPPC Operations System

Source of truth: docs/SPEC.md. Do not invent business rules. If a rule is missing or unclear, stop and ask.

## Stack
TypeScript, Next.js (App Router), PostgreSQL 16, pg-boss jobs, S3-compatible private storage, PWA for field users.

## Rules
1. Every API route is wrapped in route(permission, handler). No route without a permission. Permissions are checked on the server.
2. Migrations are numbered SQL files in packages/db/migrations. Never edit an applied migration; add a new one.
3. Issued documents (SO, DR, gate pass, billing summary, return receipt) are never edited or deleted: void with a reason.
   pallet_movements and audit_log are append-only; corrections are reversal entries.
4. Money is numeric(14,2). No floating point for money. Store UTC, display Asia/Manila.
5. Every state change writes an audit_log row in the same transaction.
6. Segregation of duties (spec 8.3): approver is never the creator or the payee. The Owner approves every voucher.
7. Write the test first for each business rule. Name tests after the rule id (BR-06 etc.).
8. Never log passwords, PINs, tokens, TOTP secrets or photos.
9. Field screens (driver, helper, guard, worker) are mobile-first, big buttons, and work offline with idempotent sync.
10. Exports (billing, payroll) are permission-gated and audited.
11. Settings live in the settings table (spec 7.1), never in constants. Grants and ownership follow spec 7.10 (migrations run as a separate owner role). Add new tables only with their grants, `updated_at` where mutable, and rerun the 7.11 trigger step.
12. Notes to remember: trips.status 'returned' means the truck is back at the plant; crew pay by trip type is in BR-29; completed_at semantics are in spec 10.5.
13. Permissions come from one catalog (spec 10.2). PIN sessions can never use a sensitive permission. Quantities on trips live in trip_lines; every in_transit movement carries a trip_id.

## Definition of done for a slice
Migration + API + UI + tests (rules, permissions matrix, IDOR) + audit rows + short note in docs/CHANGELOG.md.

### 19.3 First prompts to give Claude Code

1. "Read docs/SPEC.md and CLAUDE.md. Create the monorepo skeleton from section 9 with docker-compose Postgres. Apply the SQL in sections 7.1 and 7.2 as migrations 0001 and 0002. Write DB tests for next_doc_no (100 parallel inserts, no gaps), forbid_mutation and the audit hash chain. No UI yet."
2. "Implement slice S0.3 and S0.4: authentication (password with argon2id, TOTP, device-bound PIN, sessions) and the RBAC seed with the route() wrapper. Add a test that loops over every role and every permission and checks it against the matrix in section 8.4, and a test that a PIN session is rejected for every sensitive permission."
3. "Implement slice S1.7: ledger postings for dispatch, delivery and return, plus the opening balance import. Test BR-06 (rent starts at signed DR, stops at return receipt, end-of-day rule) using fn_location_daily_balance."

### 19.4 Checks that must pass in CI

- Every route declares a permission (static check).
- Permission matrix test (each role denied what it should be denied).
- IDOR tests: client A cannot read client B; a driver cannot read another driver's trip; a worker sees only own earnings.
- SoD tests: self-approval of SO, voucher, production entry and payroll step is rejected.
- Ledger tests: negative stock blocked; movements and audit rows cannot be updated or deleted.
- Billing test: pallet-days and amount match a hand-calculated month.
- Audit chain verification returns no broken row, including when the verifier runs under a different session time zone.
- Generated copies (SQL seed, §8.4 matrix) equal the catalog in §10.2.
- Grants: `app_user` is not the owner of any table and sees all rows; `app_client` sees only its client's rows.
- Trip-line tests: loaded qty can be recorded after the DR is issued; delivered qty after dispatch; both are frozen afterwards; a line cannot be added or removed once a DR is issued.
- Over-delivery test: a DR that would push live DRs above the sales order qty is refused; a voided DR frees its quantity.
- Returns tests: a class C pallet can return from a site that received it as A; a lost pallet leaves the site, stops accruing rent and is charged at replacement cost once; charges do not change if the matrix changes later.
- Billing tests: a disputed summary frees its dates for the revision; totals that differ from the lines are refused; lines change only while the summary is a draft.
- Payroll tests: pickup and internal trips pay no crew; a return trip does; a sign-off for an old round or a stale total is refused.
- Owner-raised voucher: no approval request exists for it, Finance still has to release.
- Reissue tests: a voided DR, gate pass, voucher or billing summary can be re-created; a rejected production entry can be re-entered; a voided payroll line can be paid again; a live duplicate is still refused.
- Overlap tests: two active rate terms, two live billing summaries or two payroll periods covering the same dates are refused.
- Billing test for the pre-contract case: days before the contract start are billed at the proposal rate; a day with pallets and no rate term blocks finalisation.
- RLS tests: `app_user` sees all rows; `app_client` sees only its client's rows and none when `app.client_id` is unset.

## Appendix B — Piece rates seen in the August production tracker (verify before seeding)

| Activity (as written) | Rate (₱) |
|---|---|
| BNEP (brand new ECR pallet) fabrication | 17.50 / pc |
| ECR repair Class A&B | 15 / pc |
| BNEP blue paint | 10 / pc |
| BNEP orange paint | 10 / pc |
| BNEP brown paint | 6 / pc |
| ECR repair paint | 5 / pc |
| ECR repair dipping | 2 / pc |
| Good pallet paint / dipping | 5 / 2 per pc |
| Branding (Unilever) | 2 / pc |
| Chamfering bottom board | 3 / pc |
| Shipping/loading (Unilever pallet) | 35 / pallet |
| Onsite repair (GCI, DMPI, Unilever) | 10 / pc |
| Onsite baklas (dismantling whole pallets) | 20 / pc |
| Onsite BER (NAM) | 15 / pc |
| Plainer (planing lumber, notches for bottom boards), daily | 600 / day |
| Unloading container van 4×20 | 3,600 lump sum |

Observed: ~30 workers/day, daily payout ₱10k–₱36k, ~455–540 BNEP pallets on busy days. Rates appear to vary per client and activity, which is why `activity_rates` supports client-specific, effective-dated rates.

## Appendix C — What the source documents told us

- **Proposal (Onestop Warehousing, 29 Oct 2024):** 240-pallet minimum, ₱0.85/pallet/day VAT-exclusive, 1-year minimum, damage matrix A–E/BER/Lost, monthly audit with 5-day notice, 30-day payment, 5-business-day dispute window, agreement to be signed within 15 days of first delivery, validity date, client collects pallets from the depot. All encoded as business rules BR-05 to BR-12 and as proposal fields.
- **Company profile:** 1.7 ha plant (expandable by 1.3 ha), ~10,000 pallets/month, ~600,000 in circulation, goal 1,000,000 deployed; milling in Cagayan de Oro with weekly container shipments; services include onsite and mobile repair, pallet audit, handling seminars, painted pallets, pallet protector.
- **Payroll summary:** weekly totals, headcount, average/highest/lowest, manhours. Reproduced by the report in §7.7.
- **Production tracker:** one sheet per day with many activity blocks and an employee gate-pass sheet (employee gate pass is included as a small HR module in Phase 2).

## Appendix D — Review log (v0.4 → v0.5)

Every finding from the Claude Code review of v0.4, what changed, and where.

| # | Finding | Fix | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pre-contract deliveries billed at ₱0 | Rates come from `site_rate_terms` (proposal term, then contract term); unpriced days block finalising | §7.3, §7.6, BR-28, BR-10 |
| 2 | No pallet type/condition on trips, DRs, returns | `trip_lines`; DR total is the sum of lines; `return_receipt_lines.pallet_type_id`; postings loop over lines | §7.4, §10.5, §10.8 |
| 3 | Voids/rejections/reopen block reissue | Partial unique indexes on DR, gate pass, voucher; billing summaries use an overlap `EXCLUDE` that ignores void; production entry index ignores rejected; payroll lines carry `voided_at` | §7.4, §7.6, §7.7 |
| 4 | Audit hash depends on session time zone | One `audit_row_hash` used by trigger and verifier, timestamp as fixed UTC text, explicit NULL markers | §7.1 |
| 5 | RLS hides every DR from the app | `app_user` and `app_client` roles with explicit policies; client policies fail closed | §7.10 |
| 6 | No client-pickup path without voucher | `voucher_required` generated column; separate pickup transition table and POD rule | §7.4, §10.4, BR-26 |
| 7 | Overlapping contracts double-count | `EXCLUDE` on `site_rate_terms` | §7.3, BR-28 |
| 8 | Billing export: matrix vs code | Both generated from one catalog; Billing and Finance both export | §10.2, §8.4 |
| 9 | Production entry: HR, drivers, helpers | HR read-only; drivers/helpers have no production permission | §10.2, §8.4 |
| 10 | No `trips.read` | Added (`trips.read`, `dr.read`, `billing.read`, `production.read`, `payroll.read`, `rates.read`, `proposals.read`) | §10.2 |
| 11 | Ops Mgr "A" on trips undefined | `wo.approve` | §10.2 |
| 12 | Returns, audits, signed DR have no permission | `returns.record`, `pallet_audit.write/approve`, `dr.receive` | §10.2 |
| 13 | HR computes then signs off payroll | System job computes; HR proposes adjustments, Owner approves; sign-offs tied to frozen total and round | §7.7, §10.7, §8.3 |
| 14 | Photo size 10 MB vs 2 MB | 2 MB for delivery photos everywhere | §8.5, §10.6, §11 |
| 15 | No holiday calendar for BR-08 | `holidays` + `add_business_days` | §7.1, BR-08 |
| 16 | Owner-raised voucher cannot be approved | `owner_raised` auto-approval, Finance still releases, DB `CHECK` | §7.4, BR-27 |
| 17 | Trip pay dated by planned date | Dated by `completed_at` (Manila date) | §7.4, §10.7, BR-17 |
| 18 | §7.9 after §8; M13 before M12 | Reordered; new §7.10 for roles and RLS | §5, §7 |
| — | Found while fixing: PIN sessions not technically barred from money permissions | `sensitivity` on every permission; enforced in `requirePermission` | §8.1, §10.3 |
| — | Found while fixing: a site could be paired with another client's order | Composite foreign keys `(site_id, client_id)` | §7.2, §7.4, §7.6 |
| — | Found while fixing: in-transit stock shared by all trucks | `pallet_movements.trip_id`, per-trip balance check, `v_trip_in_transit` | §7.5 |
| — | Found while fixing: overlapping rate/payroll periods | `EXCLUDE` constraints on activity rates, trip pay rates, payroll periods | §7.7 |

## Appendix E — Review log (v0.5 → v0.6)

A second review of v0.5 (by another AI) and its proposed patch were checked against the spec and against a running
PostgreSQL 16 before anything was applied. "Changed" means the idea was right but the proposed fix would not have worked
as written.

| # | Finding | Verdict | What v0.6 does | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | No `settings` table | Valid | Typed table plus seed. The proposed `min_rate` of 0.60 was invented, so it is left empty for the Owner | §7.1, §10.1 |
| B2 | No grants for `app_user`/`app_client` | Valid; changed | Least-privilege grants (the proposal gave `DELETE` on every table), default privileges, revoke on append-only tables, owner role rule | §7.10 |
| B3 | `processed_ops` never created | Valid | Table added | §7.4 |
| B4 | Proposal has no sites | Valid; improved | `proposal_sites` and `contract_sites` with composite keys to the same client | §7.3 |
| B5 | Damage and lost charges not specified | Valid; extended | Frozen charge per return line, `fn_damage_rate`, billing query, lost pallets leave the site ledger (the proposal left them on the site, so rent would continue) | §7.4, §7.6, §10.8, BR-12 |
| B6 | Portal action permissions | Valid | `portal.approve_billing`, `portal.dispute_billing`, `portal.raise_concern`; API checks documented | §10.2, §7.10 |
| B7 | Trip pay includes pickup/return/internal | Valid | Limited to delivery and return (BR-29) | §10.7 |
| B8 | Owner voucher vs approval check | Valid | No approval request for the Owner's own approval | §10.8, BR-27 |
| B9 | Disputed summary blocks its revision | Valid; changed | `EXCLUDE` ignores void and disputed, written into the table definition (the proposal dropped a guessed constraint name); `revised_from_id` | §7.6 |
| B10 | `set_updated_at` never attached | Valid; changed | Columns added in the table definitions; one step attaches the trigger to every table with `updated_at` (the proposal listed tables that do not exist) | §7.11 |
| I1 | `zone_rates` no overlap/`set_by` | Valid | Added | §7.2 |
| I2 | Notification preferences | Valid | Table added | §7.9 |
| I3 | `trip_lines` editable | Valid; **changed** | The proposed trigger froze quantities at dispatch and at DR issue, which would have blocked recording loaded and delivered quantities. Each column now has its own freeze point | §7.4 |
| I4 | Voucher for internal trips | Valid | Voucher only for delivery and return (assumption, BR-29) | §7.4 |
| I5, I6, I7 | Recovery codes, PIN lockout, audit index | Valid | Added | §7.1 |
| I8 | Sign-off total only in app | Valid; extended | Trigger also checks the round and the period status | §7.7 |
| I9 | Billing totals can drift | Valid; extended | Trigger also checks other charges; lines editable only while draft | §7.6 |
| I10 | Missing `updated_at` | Valid | Added | various |
| I11 | `received_at` NOT NULL on draft | Valid | Nullable, required once received | §7.4 |
| I12 | Over-delivery | Valid; changed | Uses the DR's own order id and a lock for parallel inserts | §7.4 |
| I13 | Owner single point of failure | Valid risk | Optional delegate, off by default, flagged; you decide | §7.4, §18 |
| C1 | `completed_at` after late paper DR | Valid | Set at unloading (`markDelivered`) | §10.5 |
| C2, C3 | Column names, `returned` status | Noted | Kept; documented | §18 |
| C4 | Current cutoff view | Valid | Added | §7.2 |
| — | `employees.pay_type` not checked | Valid | Trigger on production entries | §7.7 |
| — | `ticket_messages.file_ids`, audit counts as JSON | Valid | Join table and `pallet_audit_lines` | §7.8 |
| — | Payroll job identity | Valid | `system` actor and job table | §9.1 |
| — | Timeline optimistic | Judgement | Range widened to 5–6 months for Phase 1 | §16 |
| — | Found while checking | — | Returning pallets could not change condition at a site; fixed by tracking site stock by type | §7.5 |
